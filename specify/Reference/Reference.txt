1. On atomizing reference works. Not sure the same (agent atomization) is true of reference works (citations) although similar attribution metrics are at play there and may be useful to capture.  However, in this case the DOI may function as a proxy for any atomization of data in this case and provides opportunities for automated atomization through a service.  Given that there are DwC extensions for reference works and the various terms are atomized therein, maybe this is something to consider.  This would however require a one-to-many relationship to author (agent) IDs which may be going too far.  Lots of the agents in my agent list are authors of citations and not linked anywhere else in the data model.
2. Reference work type is currently exported as an ID and needs to be converted into text as post-process as follows: 2 - JOURNAL_ARTICLE, 4 - DISSERTATION, 5 - BOOK_SECTION, 3 - TECHNICAL_REPORT.
