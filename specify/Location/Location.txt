1.  This complement of fields is contained in three separate tables - collecting event attribute (just depth fields), locality and geography (which is stored as a heirarchical tree).
2. We do not have a municipality field or distance_above_surface (how do these differ from elevation?) fields
3. Currently do not have any way of restricting codes to just country so they are entered for country and state.  These could probably be removed through post-processing.
4. Geography GUIDs added as they are not assigned by default
