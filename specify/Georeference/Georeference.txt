1. Specify does not have a separate georeference table and most fields (lat, long, datum, method) are incorporated into the locality table.  There is a geocoordinate detail table that includes precision, georeferenced by, georeferenced date, remarks, etc. fields. So, there are a mix of fields from the locality and geocoordinate detail table here.  Not all localities have geocoorddetail entries so not all will have ID's.
2.  What about latitude 2, longitude 2?
3. Not sure what footprint fields are?
4. Not sure what point_radius_spatial_fit field is?
