1.  Digial assets are connected to various tables within Specify - collection objects, collecting events, preparations, etc.  As such there will need to be concatenation of various files in order to get them all into a single digital_entity file
2.  There are some assets that are connected to records based on a static URL as a weblink (e.g. Morphosource links for CT scans or Macauley Library for sound and video files).  The unique identifier is added to a field and a weblink is created with the base URL after which the URL is created on the fly when clicking the weblink button.  There is currently no way to process these in the same way as physical files that are attached to records as I am unable to export the URL for the field.
3.  Specify needs to move to a system where attachments can be physical files or URL links and which are all found in the same location for each table so they can be exported as a single entity.
4. Genetic sequence URI's needed to be generated in post-process due to the same weblink field problem that generates Genbank links.
