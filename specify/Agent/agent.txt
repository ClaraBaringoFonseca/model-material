1. Unable to export agent type as text concept.  Specify 7 exports this as a value which will need to be post processed into the concept with the following values - 0=organization, 1=person, 2=other, 3=group).  This will hopefully be fixed in future versions of Specify 7.
2. On atomizing agents to individual fields.  My thinking here is that for agents specifically, there are multiple ways in which agents are represented by various CMS’s and other entities as concatenated strings – first name, middle initial, last name or last name, first name, middle initial, etc.  This brings about confusion across data sources when trying to If we ever hope to align these concepts across resources (which has been discussed at length in various circles and I think is a laudable goal for various initiatives – attribution being one of them), then creating some structure around these would be useful.  If agents are going to be a thing going forward then it makes sense to be able to map these to the various places where they are used in traditional CMS’s – cataloger, determiner, collector, author, using the primary key ID’s you have articulated as part of this agent table and structure them so that they can be aligned across the data universe.  That being said, I am not sure how “doable” this is for most data publishers.  I know that some CMS’s do not have agents parsed this way (Symbiota for one - I think) and so this may not be a useful exercise.  Thus I am torn between the utility of a comprehensive agent table, its usefulness, and our ability as a community to deliver such atomized data that is useful.
3.  The collection agent needed to be added in post-process as there is no agent in the agent table in Specify for this.
